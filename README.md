## Ascending Notes Documentation

# Introduction

This documentation aims to ensure that our components function according to CRUD and reliably in our Ascending Notes application. Users will also have the ability to save their note, star it to mark its importance and also delete notes.

Our target audience are fellow students, developers, QA engineers who are interested in using and testing our notes application. 

Unit tests are essential and play a crucial role in the overall testing strategy by focusing on individual units or components of a software system. Unit tests for React components are there to help catch bugs early in the development process and ensure that each component behaves as expected. Testing is necessary for the following reasons: bug detection and prevention, enhanced user experience, increased confidence in releases, cost savings, maintaining business reputation, adaptability and scalability, and regulatory compliance.

# Test Environment Set Up

Before running any tests, ensure you have the following dependencies installed: 
- Node.js (version 12 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)


We utilized Jest version 29.7.0 and also React Testing Library version 14.2.1. 

Dependencies we have in our package.json file: 

      "devDependencies": {
        "@babel/preset-env": "^7.23.9",
        "@babel/preset-react": "^7.23.3",
        "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^6.4.1",
        "@testing-library/react": "^14.2.1",
        "@testing-library/user-event": "^14.5.2",
        "@types/react": "^18.2.43",
        "@types/react-dom": "^18.2.17",
        "@vitejs/plugin-react": "^4.2.1",
        "eslint": "^8.55.0",
        "eslint-plugin-react": "^7.33.2",
        "eslint-plugin-react-hooks": "^4.6.0",
        "eslint-plugin-react-refresh": "^0.4.5",
        "jest": "^29.7.0",
        "jest-environment-jsdom": "^29.7.0",
        "postcss": "^8.4.33",
        "postcss-preset-mantine": "^1.12.3",
        "postcss-simple-vars": "^7.0.1",
        "vite": "^5.0.8"
      }

More information regarding how to configure [Jest (https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration)] and [React Testing Library (https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/setup/)] can be found on the official documentation website. 

Test Files for Jest: 
The jest.setup.js file allows you to set up any global configurations, custom matchers, or setup code that you want to run before each test suite in your Jest environment. It acts as a setup file for Jest, hence the name.
The jest.config.js file is used to configure Jest's behavior and options for your project. It allows you to specify various settings such as test environment, test match patterns, setup files, coverage configurations, and more.

#Test File Structure

Our files are organized according to components. Each component has its own file and the respective test in the same folder.
